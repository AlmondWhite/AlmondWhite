Over the past months I come to finally learn that posting here on a regular basis does not mean anything really. I don't say that in a depressing way, I just mean I think that I have found my pace. Finally.




This blog is littered with little challenges that I had set myself and failed at miserably. Things that I had set out to do in order to justify it's creation. Initially I had the idea to post 3 or 4 segments a week, then there was the whole *post it while you're drunk* crap, and finally the hugely embarrassing *Spooktober*. I wear these failures as a badge of honor now though, as I have come to learn to just do what's natural. 

Sure, this whole process may have taken me around a **year** to learn, however, the takeaway is: I got there in the end. 

As the dawn of a new decade looms over us, we all have our resolutions I'm sure, and I know mine will be to continue this little passion project at my own pace. I mean, let's be honest here, I don't believe for a single second that anyone other than myself has even visited this site all year, let alone read anything. 

This marks the end of a dumb cycle for me. I will of course continue to keep posting. I've got some cool things on different C# frameworks I'd love to talk about, publishing Node.Js apps using different encryption methods, the beauty of console applications, etc. All in due time. 



More to come.
