No not in that way... I mean transitioning from old habits to new ones. I’ve had quite a number of blogs (if you can call them that) in the past, each exploring different topics. I am in no way going to name any of them as even though they’re all long gone now, the WayBack Machine could always shed a little light. Either way, they were quite niche. By niche I mean shit.

I tried focusing on tech, oddities, the arts, culture, etc, with varying degrees of success. However, the one thing no one tells you when you start a blog, consistency is key. 

When your public interest is 50% based upon your relativity and content and 50% based on your ability to constantly update and keep eyes on the site, the way you plan out the construction of your site really plays a pivotal role. That was a long sentence. 

I had experimented with different themes and attractions when building sites in the past. The more complex you make them, the more time-consuming adding to them will be. My last site was built to look like it had been pulled directly off the net in the 90’s. Compressed images, static fonts, crappy colors, borders everywhere… And it pulled it off nicely. The point was to have something so simple that adding new pages and articles would be easy and quick. Nope. Not the case.

Which brings me to here. I had to employ 0.8% of my time to write this post, commit it and see it on the site. I literally wrote this on my lunchbreak. Consistency is key and I’m on it!

I have a couple of concepts in mind with respect to what content I want to explore here, but I’m weeding out the weak-points still. More soon!
