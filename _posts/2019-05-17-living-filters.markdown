A few months ago I wanted to invest in some plants for my office, not only for decorative purposes but to provide some kind of function. There are millions of different species of plants (don’t quote me) in the world and I knew there had to be some that would aid my current issue.

I’m a poor-ass motherfucker most of the time, I spend the majority of my waking hours behind a desk and four monitors in my office. For a while I’ve been having an issue with the roof in there leaking during periods of heavy rain. This is mostly over the winter months, and it being cold in the winter, I had the heater running whenever I could. Long, boring story short, I got a very small patch of mold in one of the far corners of the room. I’m no fucking mold expert but I have heard in the past that breathing that stuff in is seriously detrimental to your health, especially over long periods of time.

Bleached and washed in vinegar, all that shit was wiped out. The remaining thing was waiting till I could afford to get the roof fixed, the air was pretty damp. I have two huge salt rocks that do an awesome job of sucking up the damp but I thought a plant may also serve that purpose as well as maybe cleaning the air a little.

Went to the garden center, picked up a bonsai (Ficus Ginseng) because they’re awesome, and I grabbed another indoor plant at random. I knew about bonsai care for the species I picked but I really didn’t know anything about the other plant I grabbed. Dug around online and it turns out this plant is called the [“Dracaena Deremensis”][DD-link]. This thing is listed by NASA in their “Clean Air Study” as one of the best natural filtrations of airborne toxins. Just what I need. Both plants are still going strong today and don’t need too much care or pruning.  

After hearing that this plant got the attention of NASA, it got me curious about the everyday effects on the body and mind when around something like this. That took me down a huge rabbit hole. Raised air quality, increased productivity, improved levels of optimism, things you initially think is all hippy speak but turns out to have real scientific backing (15% increased productivity rate in project development). 

Anyway, the most interesting form of proof to suggest all of this has basis in reality I found was the way Amazon had [designed their offices around the concept][amazon-link]. They made these huge spherical greenhouses to house miniature jungles in their head offices. Apparently, all because of these findings. Crazy shit if you ask me.
