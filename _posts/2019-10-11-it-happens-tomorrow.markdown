I’m finally going to take the plunge and purchase my first Apple device from an actual Apple store. Fucking exciting, I know...


I’ve been getting increasingly more annoying over the past few weeks about all things Apple. A post here, a rant there, an admission of contradicting ideals and, ultimately, succumbing to the continued use of the products this company puts out. I do apologize for the incessant blabbering on this topic, and trust me, it being October, this is not what I wanted to devote the “digital pages” in my online notebook to.

I’m going through that kind of phase I’ve seen some folks go through in the past. I’m sure anyone reading this has at some point had it happen that a medium, person or, in my case, product you had never really payed much attention to in the past suddenly catches your interest in a way that results in you actually taking up the mantle of some form of fandom. I’ve mostly seen this happen with people who hear a new song for the first time, don’t think much of it, but upon hearing it a few more times actually end up liking it and exploring the artist further, sometimes to the point of becoming a fan. That pretty much sums up this fad I’m in. 

The difference between you and I in this situation is that you probably kept an instance such as this in your life to yourself and didn’t think it worthy of publishing it online. I don’t think it worthy of publishing online either, but dammit, this is my blog and I have to post something to justify spending money on a domain.


The only tablet I’ve ever owned was a Nexus 7. I bought it 2 or 3 years later after its initial release and payed about 75 bucks for it. The only reason I purchased it was to build a NetHunter device and have some fun. It was a piece of shit even back then. I couldn’t visit a site or open an image on the thing without it overheating or the battery dying after 12 minutes of usage. It sucked balls, my friends. With this, my interest in tablet devices wained evermore. 

Even after this crappy experience, I had less interest in iPads all together. Every time I saw someone using one it just looked like an oversized iPod. There was hardly any difference in the OS on either, until now that is… 

iPadOS is proving to be Apple’s first attempt at actually putting most of its customer’s requests in motion and converting the iPad into something more than a screen you give to your pain in the ass child to keep them quiet in a waiting room. Looks like you can actually get some work done on now. To test it out, I plan to uphold my long drawn out promise of finally uploading some *spooky* Halloween content on here. The whole post, it’s graphic and the upload itself will be done from the tablet. I’ll both keep my promise and quell my annoying digital diarrhea on the topic hopefully. 


Goodbye Apple posts *(except for maybe one more tomorrow because I'm an excited fuck)*, hello Spooktober. 


More to come.
