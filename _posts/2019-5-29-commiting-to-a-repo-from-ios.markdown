Hello once again. Yes it has been a while since I’ve actually posted something, but I was pretty busy.


It’s Tuesday today and I usually post an update on how the whole fasting experiment is going except there’s not much to tell about on that side. I’m still on it, I’m still experiencing the same things and I’m still losing weight. Why bore anyone with that shit? Usually the most appealing thing for anyone to hear when someone tries a challenge is failure. Don’t worry, I don’t plan on failing, but if I do for some reason I’ll definitely post about it here (I need to justify the 6 bucks I spent on my domain).

Anyways, yeah I was busy. Not doing anything out of the extraordinary, just fucking work. I realized I have been slacking off on here so something must be done. So in an effort to combat this, I decided to find a quicker and more convenient way of uploading new posts. 

This is a Jekyll site, in case you haven’t noticed the shitty static layout, and as such is actually being hosted as a github repo. This basically means that anytime I want to upload a new post, I have to make a commit. Currently this is the first in a series of little tests I’m making to see how well I can update the site as I go. I’d love to be able to write a post as I sit in a bar and sip on a sweet glass of bourbon while watching the populous fade on by. 

I’m trying out an app I had avoided in the past due to my concerns with its authentication method, but has actually grown in to something pretty interesting. It’s called CodeHub and beyond my current use, I’m not sure what other people may be using it for on devices other than tablets maybe.

I’ll see how it goes. Basically I have even less excuses to not post things now.
