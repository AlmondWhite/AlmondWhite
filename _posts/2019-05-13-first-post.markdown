Welcome to the first post!
So this is a little project I'm putting together initially as a test but hopefully something I can grow in to a justifiable site. I hope to talk about all things
weird or interesting, in a way that won't bore or drone on. 

This blog is built on Jekyll, a new framework I'm trying as it appears to make updating and maintaining a site like this facile. 

I've had many sites in the past, all of which were manually created from the ground up, and as such, adding new posts or updating elements takes a toll on time and 
effort. Considering the time it takes to write a post or article, update a page template, and new custom stylings and then link that page and ensure it resolves correctly is a pain in the ass. As far as I have experienced with Jekyll, it;s simply a matter of dropping a new .md file in the respective folder and im done. 

I hope to make this project an interesting one and see how it goes from there. I've also set up a [new twitter account][twitter] to update about posts and articles while I get the RSS and subsription features up for those who are interested. More to come, thanks for stopping by!
