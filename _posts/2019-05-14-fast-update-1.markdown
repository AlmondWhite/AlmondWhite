So, Day #1 was ok, I guess. My plan is basically to allow myself a window from 9am to 2pm where I can eat meals. After 2pm I just fast until 9am the following morning. 
The meals I eat during my allotted window do fall subject to some restrictions as well, it’s pretty [keto][keto-link] based. Little to no carbs, only lean meats, a lot of protein and poultry. This is pretty much to ensure that when I eat during my window, I don’t fuck up all the work I put in fasting throughout the rest of the day. I have seen people online stating that you can eat whatever you like as long as you remain in a caloric deficit, but knowing myself, it would make it too easy for me to cross that line.
It’s a pretty straight forward concept as opposed to pure protein-based diets or calorie counting diets I’ve tried. Basically “eat at this time, not at this time and don’t push it”. I don’t have to spend each lunch break reading the fine print on the back of everything to see how honest FatCo.inc are.
I did get pretty hungry towards the night but once I woke up in the morning, I looked at the time and realized it was almost 9am (my window). It was a little motivation to get up. I do feel pretty tired today but I’m not sure how much of that is coming from the diet and how much is coming from my sleeping habits.
I’ll see how long I can stick to it and hopefully in a weeks’ time I’ll have something more to say about it.
