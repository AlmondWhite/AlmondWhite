I read a post from a *‘facts’* based account on Twitter (I know, I know, I should know better than trusting shit from Twitter), and it had a pretty weird impact on me. 


The tweet was the following:

> The neurological effects of cocaine are similar to falling in love.

Now, preconceptions aside, I’m sure most of us can grasp the concept here. Some more than others, probably…

The *impact* I was referring to though, has nothing to with coke or love, but a sudden motivation to ponder; *What other event could cause little rushes of endorphins, such as this?* I mean we all find some crutch or other throughout our lives, regardless how big or small. Some opt for that sweet little glass of bourbon before bed, others can be accidentally stepped on in an alleyway with an empty syringe dangling from their inner elbow. Stark contrasts, I know, but you get what I mean. 

There are always *alternatives*, or perhaps more accurately put, *‘supplements’* for whatever habit you employ to break up the ass-ache life can be sometimes. Smokers can swap out cigarettes for vapes or nicotine gums, obese folks can trade burgers for broccoli, and alcoholics can switch hitting the juice for juice… or not. 

I wonder if there are non-psychologically or physically dependent *’treats’*, let’s call them, that we can find to enjoy without the evident side-effects that might tag along through usage. Endorphin causing of course, but I don’t mean shit like sports or learning a new craft. I mean even smaller things that wouldn’t really cause or require much, if any, mental or physical input at all. 

It’s been a while since I watched any anime, but I remember it being something I could just slap on the screen after work or at the end of the day and zone out a bit. You’d look forward to where the premise of the show might go next but you wouldn’t be on the edge of your seat for it, and once an episode was over you could get up and walk away without it running circles around your thoughts. Am I talking shit? Probably. I mean, don’t you miss the feeling you used to get when you discovered a new band or artist that sounded great to you, and every track was so catchy you had to keep listening to them all the time? 

Maybe I’m developing an unwanted cynicism as I grow a little older, but it can’t be that hard to find hidden little joys like that, I’m sure. Just have to look around a bit, I suppose. Anyways, I don’t know what I’m rambling on about here. I did have a point but it has long been buried under poor execution by now. 


More to come. Just not like this. I’m tired.
