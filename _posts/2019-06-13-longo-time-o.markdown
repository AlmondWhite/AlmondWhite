Long time no see, blah blah blah. Many things have come to pass since last we met, dear friend.


I’ve mostly spent my time recoiling in a fetal position basted in cringe at my last bullshit posts. Anyways, the rest of my time has been spent laughing and expressing curiosity at all the Apple shit that has happened, for obvious reasons. To sum this up briefly, they are finally joining the rest of the world in  UI advancements and basic features that were already available across alternative platforms for fucking years now. Dark Mode, USB storage connectivity and such. 

It pisses me off that people are hailing them as innovators and the second technological revolution, having announce these long awaited (and expected) updates. Don’t get me wrong, I love Apple products, I use them, but the fact that they were able to turn admittance that they are stubborn as fuck and other OS’s have surpassed them in this regard into them appearing as though they’re setting the trend, is beyond me.  

Aside from this, I’ve been grinding hardcore in Electron, work mostly, but enjoyable work. Still a lot to learn but bridges will be crossed as they appear. 

As for the IF updates, yeah I’m in month two and still going with it. It does appear that the whole rush of fat dropping off me has halted a little, or at least isn’t progressing as fast as it was during the first month. I’m trying to remedy this by cutting my total food intake by half and also weight training 5 days a week. Hopefully this will yield some better results. 

That’s pretty much it. Yeah I’m fucking up on my periodic posts, but I’ll pay a little more attention. I’m trying to be a little more active on Twitter but I never managed to navigate on there comfortably.
