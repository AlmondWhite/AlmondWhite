So that time of year is upon us. I absolutely love the fall. Best time of the year I find, with its cooler temperature, its long awaited rains, the appreciation towards a comfortable home setup and a time in which we unknowingly actually spend just a little more time on self-reflection.


I find it does speak volumes towards people’s character when hearing which season they take to the most. More often than not people will tell you summer is their favorite. Beaches, holidays, cocktails and more scantily clad folks bouncing up and down as they skip to the next bar or beach resort,  tend to be some of the more tantalizing inflections folks make. 

I’ve generally found that those who lean towards enjoying the summer months are more outgoing and confident in their ways than those who enjoy the autumn season, for instance. Similarly, those who enjoy the deep winter tend to be more family-centric and those who opt for anticipating the spring are often vocal about welcoming a new year as the one they’ve just experienced has been “absolute shit”. 

Most of these are probably misnomers, however this tends to be the annual cycle of seasonal expressions I pick up from those around me. 


As I mentioned, autumn is my absolute favorite time of year. I root this statement in various personal reasons, but obviously it goes without saying that the celebration of Halloween is probably the biggest of the lot. It’s probably due to some ancient vein of pagan ancestry that coarses through my genes, or some expansion on the ethos of finding a warm dry room in your house to watch the rainfall from a window that gets replaced by finding safety behind locked doors from all the creepy things that might be waiting for you outside. 


Whatever the reason, the time has come once again to welcome this great shift in our external experiences from the heat of the summer to the slight chill that begins to knock on all of our doors.
