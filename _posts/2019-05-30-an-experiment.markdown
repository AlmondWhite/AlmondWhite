Here's a test I've been wanting to try for a little while now...



A few years ago I discovered the unconditional beauty that is all things Kentucky bourbon. Tequila was my pride and joy for such a long time, having taken over from its predecessor, gin. Pretty fucking interesting I know. Anyways, to keep an esoteric story short, I’m going to sit up tomorrow night, and slowly get totally fucked up while I write the longest post of my life. 

It is a simple experiment that I think will accurately capture a portrayal of my psyche for me to better understand my loaded self. I do have a few conditions that I’m setting myself such as spelling mistakes (although highlighted in Word) must remain included, I must keep on writing for as long as I’m getting drunk, it must be interesting no matter what and it must be uploaded before the night is over.


So yeah, sounds stupid, because it fucking is. Just another little challenge I’m setting for myself that will probably only result in me garnering my own interest. Whatever it’ll be interesting at least. I hope. Stay tuned.
