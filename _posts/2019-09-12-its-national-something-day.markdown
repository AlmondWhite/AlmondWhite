We’re back once again to contest more of the pointless garbage found online, my friends. 


Remember when you were a kid and you knew the dates of the meaning events to look forward to in the year? Meant time off. No school or something. Now imagine being older, but still retaining the mentality of a child, and forcing everyone to play along. 

If you look around online to where the least interesting are the loudest, you’ll come to eventually find that everyone has an agenda. Sure. No problem. What pisses me off, particularly, is when people force their agendas on to you. 

Twitter. Everyone knows it, everyone ruins it. On the site, just to the right of your feed, a list of trending topics can be found. No matter what day of the year it is, you will find a hashtag accompanied the the declaration that it is *National* something *Day*, or *World* something *Day*… The fuck? When did it become everyone’s collective mission to declare certain days of the year to whatever fairy tale bullshit they found most appealing?   

Well guess what my friends, today is apparently *”National Video Games Day”*… Have you heard about this? Did somebody call you? I certainly didn’t get a fucking phone call or email or calendar invite. I don’t remember watching a public hearing on television, in which a unanimous vote was put forth by a party of representatives for the planet of Earth. 

Do you?...No. Right. So they can go fuck themselves, and anyone else who comes up with this garbage. 

Goodnight. 


More to come.
