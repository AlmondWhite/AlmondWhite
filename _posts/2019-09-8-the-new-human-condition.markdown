Lately I’ve been noticing something that I’m more than certain previous generations have been through. In fact, I’m pretty sure most people go through at some point in their lives. 


We all go through varying phases throughout our life. I haven’t lived as long as some, but I would assume that we never really do stop going through phases along the course of our existence. Childhood and adolescence are some of the most talked about, I think it’s because for most these periods are either some of the most influential in the development of our character. It could also be the fact that we regard them highly in contrast to our experiences later in life, as they may remind us of a simpler time with simpler choices to make. 

Another notable phase, most don’t probably welcome as much as others, is middle-age. Even the term *“middle-age”* can carry some negative connotations for some, as the word *middle* seems to imply a half-way point in your life. This, evidently, tends to get directly coupled with the all too familiar expression *mid-life crisis*. 


What do we refer to as the point between adolescence and middle-age? That I’m not too sure of. If there is such a term for it, I certainly am not familiar with it. I think it’s just called living, I guess. It’s quite strange, as it would appear to me that we make most of our life-defining choices in that period. Things like who we marry or what we name our children, what career path we aim to secure. I’ve heard of *adulthood* before, but it seems like a less specific term than *childhood*. That could really apply to any point in your life after adolescence.

I’m not trying to get caught up on terminology here. In fact, how we refer to all of this plays a pretty unimportant role in my point. What does require more attention, I believe, is how we manage these milestones. It’s an unspoken rule of life, the fact that when it comes down to it, you have only yourself to manage how any of these periods develop you as person. Which moments you choose to carry with you, which ones you choose to leave behind and which ones you choose to allow to affect you for better or worse. 


I saw a movie recently, I won’t bore you with the specifics of which, but it belonged to a franchise that was bought by another company during the filming process. From the directing to the writing and acting, you could see that the cast and crew were just phoning it in, as they already knew there was nothing of the franchise left to save. 

*I hear you asking: Well what the hell has that got to do with anything you’ve just said? I know it seems a bit off topic but stick with me here, it’ll tie in. I promise.*

 We live in a time where anyone can become an international celebrity at any age. Where anyone can become as rich or poor as never before possible. Where our socio-cultural zeitgeists no longer shift from decade to decade, like the 60’s or 70’s, but appear to change sporadically over the course of a few short years. Where things like heritage, attraction and understanding are manipulated and exploited to the point where they can be used as tools for the purpose of leveraging an ideology above those opposing whom must be squashed. 

My question is, has anyone noticed? Or like the film I was referring to earlier, are we just phoning it all in? *[See? I told you it would tie in again]*.


You don’t have to be immortal to take note of the fact that to realize that anyone raised in their own era or decade will always lend time to imagining their experiences as having more of an impact than that which they haven’t been through, and I’m not here to argue that. I realize there is no time like the present. To recall my opening statement, I’m more than certain previous generations have gone through this too. I’m not fucking special over here.


It’s the long established *light at the end of the tunnel* we all seek, I feel gets us through these phases. In reality, it’s all we really have to get us through these phases In life. No one knows how things are going to play out. So what’s the incentive here? And I’m not talking about long term goals, we all have those. What’s your dream in life? They like to ask you that one. What do you want to accomplish in 5 years time? or 10 years time? or whatever.

I’m talking about the day to day things. What gets you up in the morning or what helps you sleep at night. Some like to say *”Well it’s the pursuit of those long term goals that motivate me”*. That may be the case with some, but it doesn’t last all damn day.

What do you do when every song you hear sounds so shitty you just couldn’t be bothered to listen to music willingly? Or when every movie you see is just the same old shit? When your dog dies? When you get a flat tire?  When you can’t pay your rent? 


I’m sorry if this post sounds a bit depressing and melodramatic, this is really not my intention. I’m just so curious to find out if there *is* some common denominator that ties us all together beyond finding a crutch to lean on. I think it’s a wonderful thing that as a species we’ve evolved beyond requisites of survival and delved in to the murky realm of comfort, so heightened that questions like this can be asked. I don’t mean to bring you down. 

I’m just wondering if you too had come across this in your *“adulthood”*.


Anyways, to brighten the mood, please find attached a superb picture of a little monkey. He does have a silly face on him, and rest assured, I won’t stray in to a heavy rant like this for quite some time. 

More to come.
