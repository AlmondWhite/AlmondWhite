It’s been exactly a week since I started my intermittent fasting challenge. I’ve come to learn a few things here and there, and I have a pretty good idea about the concept going forward now.

The first week wasn’t nearly as hard as I thought it would be. The only really noticeable parts to it were the first two days. Having to sit behind a desk all day and night got me in to the habit of breaking up the monotony a little bit by looking for a reason to leave my desk for a couple of minutes each day. The easiest reason was grabbing a snack from time to time, and it was this pattern of eating throughout the day that really hits you once you choose not to all of a sudden. 

I really felt hunger at the beginning, but what convinced me to keep at it was the fact that I knew I couldn’t really be hungry. I used to be extremely skinny during a rough period in my life when I couldn’t afford much food other than a bowl of rice a day or a potato, and that was my meal for the day. I ate like that for so long that once I had my single meal I wouldn’t get hungry for the remainder of the day. This is what helped me get to this sort of “mind over matter” state and keep at it so far. 


As I’ve said in previous posts, I am doing this from a novice perspective, and I am also putting my own slight twist on it as without it I don’t think I could get through. I know lots of people who advocate fasting while still eating a fried breakfast every day, a 3 course lunch and desert but say they fast because they don’t eat after four in the afternoon. Where as its possible to do that and get some sort of result I guess, I know if I was putting myself through this whole thing I at least would want to feel like it’s absolutely going to have some result in the end, and not leave it to blind faith.
This was the reason why I decided to mix my fasting schedule with a [keto][keto-link] diet at the same time. It could have been any diet , but I like the keto diet plan and it has had some results for me in the past. 

A huge benefit that I have noticed since beginning this challenge, is the fact that I wake up a lot easier and more motivated in the morning. My window is from 9am to 2pm, and I look forward to having breakfast in the morning, and by the time lunch comes around I feel motivated once more to keep this whole thing going another day. 


Anyways, its going well so far and I aim to keep this going for a few months and hopefully mix in some new exercise routines once the process is second nature to me. Will update soon.
