Among the growing popularity of *tech* themed shows (hacking, cyber security, etc…) you can easily plot a chart of interest in technologies that have appeared in a series to similar points where the show in question’s audience has grown. 


I’m not referring to documentaries, I’m specifically speaking in reference to dramas or series. Shows like Mr. Robot for instance. I love that show. Many people do. It was only when I ventured to see what it’s dedicated subreddit looked like that I saw a huge number of fresh faces trying to get in to Linux based OS’s. 

Similarly to how everyone in *Queer as Folk* was apparently gay, everyone in Mr. Robot, from the average jail warden to a government operative, uses Linux. To us seasoned Linux dorks, this is a pretty big attraction the series brings to the table. The fact that the writers and directors involved have a team of consultants they use to bring a sense of reality in to every exploit and screenshot, is pretty cool. There are many distros shown and used throughout the series. Kali, being the most prominent of course. However, I was able to pick out Linux Mint and Slackware in a few episodes as well. 


The real interesting take away from all of this, I find, is sitting back and observing the average person’s reaction to the OS’s shown to them. The average viewer is more than aware that the show has gained some credibility among techies for its use of *real-world* tools, so they do realize they could have the option of trying them out firsthand (should they feel daring enough to get off the couch). To my surprise, there were more than a few people trying to learn about Linux, and how they could setup up an environment for themselves. Windows wankers and Apple assholes alike, wanted to creep out of their comfort zone and be more like their TV heroes. 

What I would like to touch upon though, is how accustomed most people appear to have become with having everything prepackaged for them. Granted, Windows and OSX have never been platforms to encourage creative wisdoms to run wild, with respect to personalizing your environment. You’re lucky to even have the option of fucking dark mode now. 

I gather this from the initial assumption everyone made in thinking that because a desktop environment, font-face or color theme differed between two machines, it automatically meant everyone was using a different OS. It was very difficult for people to wrap their heads around having the option to choose which desktop environment best suited them, regardless of the platform installed. 


Anyways, my point. I do take long to get to the fucking point sometimes. My point is, how do we truly judge what desktop environment suites us? I’ve spoken to seasoned veterans about this, casual users, WM snobs and distro-hoppers too. From what I gather, it’s 30% productivity and 70% team spirit. In most cases anyway…


_**The Veterans**_
***

These are those guys you hear about working in the IT sector back when you could build solitaire knockoffs on your Commodore 64. They were around before *systemd* was even a dirty little thought in some dev’s mind, and they’ll be here long after. 

They tend to opt for productivity and efficiency over style and comfort. If CPU, GPU and swapiness usage is managed well by the environment out-of-the-box, then you have some points earned with these guys. The less hassle the better. Not to say they don’t fall subject to the whole *team spirit* thing though. There will always be some loyal followers of that DE that got them to where they are, and if it ain’t broke don’t change it. 


_**The WM snobs**_
***

Most of us have a love-hate relationship with these guys, in a way. They can be real annoying, but damn it, they do make headway in the field of customization. 

Dedicated creators of the *”I use Arch btw”* memes, they’re true to their word. Which is what is interesting about them. As we know, a custom build of Arch requires the user to install and configure a DE of their choice (unless they want to run this bitch hardcore). Some of which even go so far as to restric themselves to only using certain *window managers* (hence WM snobs). 

They usually fall more in to the whole *style over substance* camp. That 70% team spirit tends to elevate from user to user. **I am going to get so much shit for writing this**. They’re mostly responsible for the 8000 posts of i3 Gaps screenshots a day on [r/Unixporn][rdt]. As I said earlier, they must be commended on how beautiful the setups they imagine are. 

They’ll tell you that they *“use i3 and Awesome for productivity”* and how it has *“changed they’re whole outlook on desktop UI’s”*, but yeah. If it helps them open Reddit and Crunchyroll faster, fair play.


_**The Casual Users**_
***

They sometimes get a rough deal for not knowing every detail on how Linux based OS’s operate, or for picking a DE because they though it looked cool. 

However, personally I find these to be the most interesting camp. Obviously due to my reasons mentioned prior, but mostly because they serve as great indicators of user-friendly or easily manageable DE’s. Kde as most know, tends to be the first choice for those trying to get out of the Windows game, or Gnome serving as a springboard of sorts for the daring OSX user. 

I don’t feel these folks are subject to the whole 30%, 70% percentile game. 


_**The Distro-Hoppers**_
***

These guys are all over the place. Some try new or challenging distros for the fun, others do it for the expressed support by the manufacturers for one desktop environment over another. They’re hard to judge correctly, but I feel a little *team spirit* comes in to play in their decisions. 

True Linux hobbyists.


_**Then there’s myself**_
***

I’ve been through a few different options. I began in Gnome, like most. Fucking hated it. Changed to Cinnamon for a while when I was a casual user. As my coding skills progressed, I started building my own distros. I found LXDE to be a pretty simple DE for me to wrap my head around in terms of modification prior to compiling. I liked the results so much that I stuck with that for a while. 

Times and needs changed, blah, blah, blah, and I ended up using KDE Neon religiously for a few years. I had used Kubuntu prior to even getting to that phase, but it was so broken it actually turned me off the whole KDE experience until I finally took the plunge once more. Mate then became my weapon of choice until recently.

Anyways, after all that shit, I’m back on LXDE. After multiple tests, and installs and exploratory sessions I think lightweight desktop environments are actually pretty badass. I was using Xubuntu for a while, but it’s nothing like my LXDE. It stays out of your way when you don’t need it, yet it’s not so subtle than you end up neglecting its advantages. 

Don’t get me wrong, I do opt for different DE’s for different reasons. Efficiency being one of course, but I’m not ashamed to say I’ve based my choice on comfort as well. I intend to use this desktop environment for day to day tasks and extended periods, so why not opt for something I feel at home using?

I’m an LXDE team player once again. 


More to come.
