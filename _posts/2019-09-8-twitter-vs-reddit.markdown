Most of us, if not on both, will have heard of one or the other. There are some pretty notable differences between these two platforms. 

<!--more-->

I’ve been a Reddit user for as long as I’ve been a Twitter user. I used to crack locked phones for some extra cash back in the day, and one day a friend came to me with an iPhone. I’ve always been an Android nut, because you know...Linux. Anyways, long story short, I cracked the iPhone, he never picked it up, my Nexus 5 broke and I had to switch to iOS for the first time in my life. 

There’s not much you can do on iOS in terms of pen-testing or virtualization as opposed to Android. I was a bit time Nethunter user and had an army of wireless dongles I used to travel with, for the fun of it. However, being broke and never having used iOS before, I had to grow accustomed to the famous restrictions Apple puts in place for its iPhone users. 

I hate mobile gaming and one of the main reasons I took to the Nexus line of phones was the ease of which you can remove cameras from the logic board, so photography was out of the question. The only real use I had to pass any time on the phone was to take the plunge and venture in to the realm of social media. In one fowl afternoon I went from having zero online presence to creating both a Twitter and Reddit account. 


I’ve never been a social media nut. I don’t share photos of my food, apply cat filters to videos of my face or feel the need to fish for compliments. Even when I do use social media, I delete and switch accounts once I feel things have gotten a little to identifiable for me and I always use pseudonyms as opposed to my real name (as you can possibly tell, my parents didn’t call me Almond). 

So anyways, having this little disconnect or lack of understanding the whole motive for engaging passionately on these sites, has kind of allowed me to stand back and take a look at the differences between each:




## Twitter


Let’s not kid ourselves here, Twitter is a fucking echo-chamber. After following a few accounts, liking a few posts on a certain topic and commenting on a few tweets of interest, you will find yourself subject to a barrage of recommendations almost specifically tailored to anything you have previously expressed interest in. Should you make the mistake of expressing an interest in one topic or account more than others, you will almost become trapped in a cycle of tweets and accounts reverberating in a cave of opinions on said topic.

It’s so much more difficult to break out of a patronizing cocoon of offers and posts on what may interest you as opposed to having easy access to ideologies or opinions that may greatly conflict with your own. It almost seems as though the platform even actively tries to avoid such moments by hiding comments on tweets that disagree with the material posted by someone. It does so by covering them up with a “More” button at the bottom of the comments listed for a given tweet. 

All this aside, it must be said that it is a great tool for focusing in on people and companies that relate to your passion or work or even your social circle. I do receive up-to-the-minute news on cyber threats an tech news due to the accounts I follow. These are things that previously would have taken me quite some time to sift through news sites and articles to find out on my own. Twitter also has a great advantage in playing home to some of the more prominent celebrities and figures in out society and allowing us to directly communicate with them. The *verified* feature also plays a great role in correctly identifying the source of information for a given account. 

However, by the same token, Twitter accounts are often maintained by individuals, each with their own likes and interests which they tweet about. This can also prove constructing a feed based around a topic or theme of your liking, difficult. This is simply due to the fact that folks will post about anything at any time. 




## Reddit


Taking in to consideration the points raised about Twitter, Reddit does things in what is almost a complete opposite approach. 

On Reddit, communities are favored more than the individual, as topics tend to be divided up in to their own little forums. There is a reason they call it *“The front page of the internet”*. You will often find that items that are posted to Reddit and gain any form of traction on the site will spread like wildfire to the rest of the internet. 

It is the forum of forums. Almost anything you can think of will have its own dedicated subreddit on the site, in which you can find an extensive community of people with the same interest as yourself and even develop a richer understanding on a topic or hobby you may have an affinity for. 

As opposed to being force-fed recommendations and feeling you are stuck in a loop of sorts when it comes to broadening your interests, Reddit allows you to easily built a feed that is unique to your passions and offers a place in which you can rate each contribution. This is done via what the site refers to as the *“karma”* system.

Any post on Reddit is subject to an upvote or a downvote, as opposed to Twitter’s like button, here you have the option of expressing unapproval instead of the whole “Like it or shut up” vibe we get from Twitter. It’s a much more community-driven experience. However, this is what may appear as a disadvantage to some, as the entire *“the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few”* ethos comes in to play. Opinion-based individuality doesn’t really shine through here, maybe in some of the comment sections, but you’re not going to get 51.3k upvotes for expressing your opinion on a political figure via a rant or posting pics of your life as regularly as you would on Twitter or Instagram for instance. 

There is a little bit of a learning curve, in the sense that you sometimes need to attain an understanding as to what interests your community before posting as it can quite literally cost you your reputation on the site. 



## Conclusion?

Well each poses their own advantages and disadvantages, as does any site. Personally, I have my reasons for still using both, however, I (like anyone else) do have a list of changes it would be nice to see implemented on either. 

Anyways, if it wasn’t apparent that this is all just my opinion, then kindly fuck off. I’m not condemning or advocating for either option. This is just my experience. Hopefully the expressed above is so far removed from general opinion that I’m alienating myself here. Anyways.


More to come.
