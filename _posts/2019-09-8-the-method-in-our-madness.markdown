Structure, planning, preparedness, efficiency and productivity. These are all things I should be practicing but don’t. Meh, I have my reasons...


With the uprising of people using platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo, there has been an apparent influx of so called “content creators” amongst the average person. Now more so than any other time in our history we can see folks try their hand at publishing documentaries, commentaries, reviews and even skits, through the medium of video. These were most commonly dominated by the television industry, however, it appears that the average person is beginning to opt for online mediums of entertainment as opposed to flicking through the tube to find something that might appeal to them. 

Cultural advancements such as these present certain implications for the future of entertainment. The most notable of which, is the ability for anyone to smack away at a keyboard for 3 to 5 minutes and easily find a piece of content tailored almost exactly to their taste. It goes without saying that almost any broadcast, movie, book, TV show or image created in the last 200 years is only a few clicks away from being fed straight in to your eyeballs. 


The fact that you may be reading this is testament to the amount of discoverable shite online. However, that’s not what I want to focus on here. What I personally find interesting, is the way in which people are adapting to this demand for content online. I’m going back to the “content creators” here for a sec. There appears to be two main avenues these folks take to when deciding to pursue their passion for publishing content online. 

The first of which is to try and imitate formats they’ve grown accustomed to seeing on TV over the years. Title animations, scripted segments, voice narration and the occasional talk show, distinguish these from the second category. 

The aforementioned ‘second category’ being those who try their hand at attempting completely new formats for their content. These tend to try to keep it as “random” and “eye-catching” as possible. These can be easily identified by the 700 jump cuts in a 2 minute video or the countless “reaction” features they publish constantly. These tend to be geared towards retaining your attention by means of editing as opposed to developing any form of rich subject matter.


It’s those who fall in to the first category that actually seem more interesting to me. Those whose apparent influence stems from things they’ve picked up off TV. The reason being is they tend to not only follow these pickups visually, but they more often than not come prepared for a new video with a script in hand, several practice runs of the episode in question and some extensive research in to the topic they want to cover. Granted, they usually just quote Wikipedia articles and mispronounce every second word, but it’s the initiative I appreciate. 

In an ideal world, each of these posts on this site would be subject to a few different drafts, proof-reading and external input prior to publishing, but no. Not at all. 


I’ve built and maintained various different sites over the years, each with their own purpose, theme and point of focus. News sites, reviews and articles of general interest were some of the pointless endeavors I embarked upon in a bid to find something that fit me. Evidently this ultimately led me here. You see, I’ve tried the whole scripting thing, the proof-reading and miniature editorial phase prior to publishing anything online, but I wanted this to be more of a natural process. 

Generally I have no clue as to what I’m going to post here until the minute I sit down to type out one of these things.  This, I know, can result in some work that may seem cumbersome to read for many, but I do personally feel quite content literally just putting the first things that come to mind on a topic directly to print. As soon as I’m done writing one of these things, I commit it straight to the site without any review prior. I’ve stated it before, but it is quite clear that I use this space as a little coping mechanism for any jargon I wouldn’t normally state openly. 


Anyways, all I’m trying to get at here is that everyone has their own way to birthing a concept and each should be commended. I have great respect for both camps of “content creator” I mentioned above as they pretty much pursue what works for them. In a world where everyone appears to be publishing something for the rest of the world to see online every minute of every day, we all benefit from a little diversity in approach. Mine makes sense to me, hopefully it will to someone else too. 

More to come.
