The Experiment


A while ago (last Thursday night) I said I’d try a little experiment where I would get paralytic on bourbon by myself and record the output to post here. Because science.


Anyways everything was going according to plan, I’d managed to get drunk on Friday night but not completely paralytic, and I recorded very little. I was most uninspired. So, I went out for a few drinks on Saturday night and came home and had a few more. Because science. This time I did get some results. Total bullshit, but results none the less. 

I can't even post the ammount of absolute garbage I spoke about so yeah. Evidently this was a waste of time other than the fun of being drunk. I don’t know if I’ll ever come up with a post while being this shitfaced again as I think it’s a waste of a page. 

The End.
