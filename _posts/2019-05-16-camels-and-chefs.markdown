“A camel is just a horse designed by committee”, so the saying goes. It couldn’t be truer. Give too many people influence and power over a shared concept and you will end up with something 700 miles from what you intended it to be.

“Too many chefs in the kitchen”, I think follows the same metaphorical logic. Usually in businesses this is something to be expected when working on a project with several members. When you work in the industry long enough you begin to realize that with most people, 80% of getting anything to go their way is achieved by bullshitting you through it. 

If someone has little experience in a field but is partaking in a project that requires them to know more than they do, the first approach they take is by attempting to discredit anyone else who knows more than them so that they can bullshit their way through it. “If I act like I’m the authority on a topic, they will accept me as one”. 


As I said earlier, when you work in a business-like environment, these things are to be expected. What I take serious issue with is when these little flaunts of hollow control then seep through into the end product. You can work with people like this by simply putting what they act like they knew better than you into motion. If you were correct, then you’ll find yourself with evidence to prove they weren’t. This of course is still a setback as they could have not wasted time in doing so and simply put the matter at hand over their own ego. Sure.

If you’re working with numbers in a spreadsheet or disputing averages to plot a chart with, then little spats like these ultimately won’t result in much if the math works out. But when you’re trying to improve a product based on customer feedback and complaints and you are told to not change a feature that was the root cause of many peoples poor experience, well you find yourself fucked. 


I can only speak from a place of software engineering as that’s my job. However, I’m sure the types that cause the sorts of problems are present in every industry. For my next project I’m going to opt for keeping my cards close to my chest when it comes to development. I have too many people with too much control over a project making decisions on a whim and without any factual basis to their claims.


I learnt much this time over. Too many fucking chefs in the kitchen producing a camel that was a horse designed by committee.
