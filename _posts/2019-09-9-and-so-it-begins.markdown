So this is just going to be a quick one, just to kick off the whole Autumn series of posts I had in mind. 

Favorite time of year, said it before, I’ll say it again. I hope I won’t be corrected on this by old Mama Nature, but I think I can officially say “the Fall is upon me now”. It has just pissed down for two days straight in my home town, temperatures have dropped over 10 degrees (Celsius) and I’ve finally been able to bust out the long PJs an put away the shorts for the time being. 

I hope it fucking lasts. 

The crystal clear essence of forest musk was more than prominent now. Always beautiful after a rainfall. Definitely missed. The commonly light distorting, rubber-melting asphalt was damp and chill on my drive home tonight. I could even see the reflections of the taillights belonging to the car in front of me enhancing every bump and pebble on the road, as I took my usual route up the mountain tonight. 

The brown mulch of pine needles and vivid greens of once dusty shrubs, peppered the forest floor as I approached the peak. Once having done so, a fresh breath of cool air slid itself through my cracked window and made its presence know by flicking the back of my neck, as one would flick a tuning fork.

I fucking love this time of year, it’s like meth to me. 


More to come.
