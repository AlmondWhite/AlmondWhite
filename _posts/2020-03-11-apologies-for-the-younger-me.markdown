As stated in one of my previous posts, a few days ago, I planned to migrate all of posts from last year over to this new build of my blog. Well, I started actually reading through them again and… They’re not the best representation of me. 

This is a brief apology on my behalf, for letting my _”rawness”_ (let’s call it) get the best of me…

As you may have noticed, I don’t run ads on my blog. Never have, never will. I’m a foolish believer of publishing content for the joy of it, as opposed to trying to monetize everything. I don’t even run a mailing list or subscription model. You will find no Patreon or BTC donations being asked for here. I write because I like to write and I share it here, because I want to express my thoughts and potentially engage in a discussion with someone. That’s where I get my kicks. Simple.

That’s all well and good, but it does not come without some connotations. Upon reading through my previous years’ worth of posts, I was able to look back and realize that the contributions I was making here, even though it was on my own website, were extremely pitiful. Pointless profanity, drunken rants, esoteric topics and senseless posts formed the bulk of my articles from 2019. So to remedy this, I have come up with my own little policy. 

I understand there is no financial stake in this project for me, I mean I pay for my domain, but that’s it. _So, why would I take the initiative of self-censorship?_ Primarily because I want to ensure that whatever readers I may have, actually enjoy reading through a post, instead of it coming off like an extended piece of Twitter dribble. I want to ensure that there is some form of takeaway or general interest in what I write here, and that it’s not just some chunk of internet garbage to be tossed on the tire fire. I will be actively forcing myself to cutback on useless language, topics and rants, and by _”useless”_, I mean unnecessary. Let’s face it, there are a million places online one could go to find that sort of stuff…

I may not be a journalist, columnist or astute writer by any means, but that doesn’t mean I can’t employ a little bit of self-respect and try to craft a more enjoyable experience for my readers, and in turn, for myself as well. 

This is why I’m making the decision to take all of my _pre-2019_ posts off the site and start with a clean slate 2020 onwards. I’ll always have them archived and they’ll always be a piece of who I was, but it’s time for me to adjust the bar of my own personal standards and try make something fun out of this. 

Thanks for reading. 



More to come.
