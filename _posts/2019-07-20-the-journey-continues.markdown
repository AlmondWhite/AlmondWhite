Having taken some time away from blogging, I can confidently look back on what I’ve written a see how arrogant and fucking boring it all is. However, the absence has also given me some time to learn new tricks…


I always aimed to be fairly consistent in my uploads, trying to document any progress I’m making in areas I wasn’t very knowledgeable in. This was essentially for me to review my progress and for those who are maybe travelling along the same lines as myself who share an interest. This has proven to be a little difficult for me, simply due to the workload I’ve been ploughing through. 


I’ve been busting my balls in Electron and Node.js for the past few weeks. It’s been fun. Hard, but fun. I’ve been documenting some packages I found in [npmjs][npmjs.com] on [my twitter account][twitter], mostly as recommendations, if they really prove helpful.

I must say, I wish something like [npmjs][npmjs.com] existed for some of the other languages I used to script in. Of course there will always be extensive pages of documentation and repos across multiple sites for Python packages and C libraries, but fuck me, [npmjs][npmjs.com] does make the task of finding the package you need facile. 


The latest project I’ve been working on was an information gathering tool for technical assessments and reviews. Simply put, it gathers all details needed about a target system and rates the findings based on a precomposed list of criteria. Turned out alright. Network speed tests, max CPU clock speeds and GEO-IP location tracking were some of the features I needed to implement (most of which I had never written before). 


Anyway, the fact that I was able to actually write all of this stuff, lead me to dreaming up my next project: a GUI based pen testing kit for Debian-based systems. I want to make it more visually appealing than what most QT apps look like, but at the same time, have it run all its functions in python. So far its just a concept and there are some pretty big caveats to the whole process (like, how the fuck am I going to get a python script to report progress back through a node.js backend and in to the html front?). 


So yeah I’ll document that one as I go. I would also like to make it completely open-source which would allow me to implement an auto update feature synced to a GitHub repo. I too haven’t tried my hand at that. 


Stay tuned!
