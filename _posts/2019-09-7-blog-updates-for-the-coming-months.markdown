Halloween is fast approaching, and as stated in my previous post I’m already fucking excited.


I’m never away from my desk or a notepad, so I can’t use the old excuse of spending more time indoors due to the autumn rainfall as a reason I might actually begin consistently posting here again. The truth is I’m probably as forgetful as I am lazy and busy. However, I do have some plans that may aid me in actually making the most of my little corner of the internet once again. 


As you can no doubt tell by the cesspool of different tags I have related to any posts I make, I haven’t really stayed in one direction at all in pursuing an overarching theme or motif for this blog. In fact the whole purpose of this blog was so that I wouldn’t cage myself in to only banging on about one topic or area of interest and could digitally dump any thoughts I deemed worthy of sitting down and typing out. 

This, as it turns out, is not good for attracting any form of a following or even the odd reader, as people generally don’t have time to waste online giving someone who doesn’t even know what they will write about, 5 minutes of their day. Had I created this site to attain any form of financial gain, one would refer to this as an issue, but that isn’t the point behind this site. 


I’m not one to call upon the world’s tiniest violin to be played for me here, but I am somewhat of a recluse. I don’t like venturing out and meeting people I don’t know, or even the ones I do for that matter. I don’t get the whole social media thing too well (as you can see from my cringey Twitter account), so the two things I partake in are bourbon and blogging. If I’m on the bourbon I’m probably too paralytic to post anything, if I’m out of bourbon then a post will usually show up here. 

Narcissistic ranting aside, I feel like showing some much needed TLC to this poor neglected basement slave of a blog and actually committing a few posts here and there as well as realizing some much needed updates.

So what can be expected? Well as mentioned I do have some good ideas for posts in mind. One of which being to commemorate Halloween by posting one new original short horror story a day during the month of October.  It’s a simple enough concept and it seems like a great way to practice consistent posting. 

Another idea I have in the pipeline, especially for this month and those in general, is to explore more topics of interest other than just coding and bitching. Potentially even creating some investigative articles or reviews on things would serve as entertaining to not only myself but those who accidentally have the misfortune of ending up here. 

I have some ideas for playing around with different themes for the aesthetics of the site from month to month as well, as a way of keeping things “fresh”, and hopefully racking up some form of feedback by announcing new posts on my Twitter for the 2 people who actually follow me. 


So yeah, don’t quote me on it but I feel these changes are needed and hopefully welcomed. More to come.
