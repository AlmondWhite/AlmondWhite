It’s the 5th already, which means a post is well overdue…




So, Autumn is officially in full swing. The fall solstice or equinox or whatever it’s supposed to be, has passed and the days are getting shorter, nights longer.  The rains had come in September but promptly left just before the month started, unfortunately. Hopefully they will be back along with some much lower temperatures. 

I had been meaning to make several posts in the past few weeks but had just taken on too many new projects recently to actually get some time to sit down and write. As you can no-doubt tell, this has also had an effect on the plans I wanted to go in to effect from the beginning of the month. This includes the whole “posting a short horror story every day of the month” challenge that I was looking forward to. That being said, I am going to be posting some whenever possible. I’ll also be sure to make them easily distinguishable from the regular posts I make, just because I know some people don’t really care for fictitious shite. 


Want to see me swallow my own words? I made a post not too long ago about the recent Apple event, in which they announced the new iPhone 11 lineup. I didn’t see the entire event, I basically began watching it from the iPhone announcement onward as it was live and stopped not too long after. I missed the sections where they announced the new changes to their iPad lineup for 2019, funny enough I actually want one. They have a new base-model that’s going for 400 bucks, or there abouts, and with the hardwire changes and they new iPadOS release it looks really good for the price. 

I ranted about how pissed off I was at the fact that Apple is one of the largest tech companies in the world and they’re only adopting features like Dark Mode, file browsers on mobile devices and ability to use external drives on their tablets in fucking 2019. I mean what the hell. Anyways, taking a look back, I and the average person still have the right to get annoyed at the stupidity of not incorporating features like these for their users earlier, but the real take away I’ve found is that Apple *is* trying. They are finally making a move on catching up with all of these long awaited minor improvements. I *do* realize now that this could mark the beginning of a little awakening in their approach to taking in user feedback for once and for all. 

In light of all this, I set myself the challenge of jumping back in to the Apple ecosystem to see if any of the improvements they have made are enough to keep me using their products as my daily drivers. I’m back on my MacBook, I’m on iOS 13, I’m going to purchase the new iPad in the upcoming weeks and I may even go as far as to get n iPhone 11 in the end. Catalina is also not too far away so that may be the final kick over the cliff I needed to actually make a valid commitment this time. I will always be a Linux guy, but this is could be an interesting change. 


In other irrelevant news; I’ve been getting back in to the whole NFL swing. Only really following the Eagles, but I am keeping track of major games. We’re in week 5 now and so far they’ve only had a 2 victories so far. I don’t really care for sports at all, and honestly, this is the last place I thought I’d be posting about it to. It’s been a few years since I’d actually followed the thing but its proving to be pretty fun. 


Anyways, you’re all caught up now I guess. Wasn’t interesting at all was it? I may post the first short story later tonight and get the ball rolling, but I got paralytic on Four Roses last night, came home and slept in a pretzel position which fucked my neck up, so don’t hold your breath if I can’t be fucked. 


More to come.
