At the time of writing this I’m watching the *Apple Special Event 2019* and, to be honest, it’s pretty underwhelming. 


I was an Android user for many years before switching to iOS about 3 years ago. As many do, I always saw Apple products as sort of elitist in a way. The high price points, costly repair stories and general scarcity  of their devices among the people I knew kind of led me to that assumption. In many ways, I wasn’t entirely incorrect. 

Following the passing of Steve Jobs, and under the leadership of Tim Cook, we have actually entered an era in which the dumbstruck and awe-shook faces that marveled at the advancements in the fields of mobile and desktop technologies that Steve seemed to present, are now intensely debating what Tim throws at them.


Since owning several Apple products myself, I have watched each *Apple Event* live as it unfolds. Over the course of just a few years I’ve seen peoples reactions change, from jaws dropping, crowds cheering and standing ovations to gasping at prices and booing at features (or lack thereof). I myself have have passed through these motions, but now… embarrassed doesn’t even begin to describe my perceptions.  

It’s no secret that Apple has a formula now. The formula itself is pretty simple and I think I can chalk it down to three simple steps:

1. Adopt a technology you have neglected, in spite of it being available for a few years.

2. Put your own twist on it by renaming it and potentially advancing it slightly.

3. Prepend the words *“Best”*, *“Most”* or *“Greatest”* and market it as your own creation.

That’s about it really. Features like dark mode, grouped notifications and wide angle cameras have existed on alternative devices for **YEARS** now, but Apple has only adopted all of these technologies in the past 2 years. I mean, if they actually payed as much attention to their customer’s needs as they like to get up on stage and talk about how much they do, they wouldn’t be so far behind independent hobbyists building these things in to platforms that don’t have them from their own homes.

Personally, unless Apple actually has some form of new revolutionizing technological advancement comparable to when Jobs stuck GPS in a phone for the first time, I don’t see the point in pissing away any more cash for a phone that restricts me from most of its capabilities, costs the same price as three higher specced alternatives and basically serves as a social media tool. 

See ya Apple.


More to come.
