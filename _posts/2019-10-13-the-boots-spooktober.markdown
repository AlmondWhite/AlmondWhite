Eleanor couldn’t sleep. The eerie sounds of midnight in the wilderness were ever-present. So present in fact, they were enough to keep her up, overanalyzing every twig snapping or branch creaking. Without the daily humdrum of cars driving by or cats rooting through the garbage that she would usually hear outside of her bedroom window, out here each sound had an endless pool of potential meanings to it. 



A rustle in the distance could be a black bear or a mouse, a screech above could be a cougar perched in a tree, or just simply a bird. This is what played on her mind. The worst part about hearing any noise in the wilderness, especially at night, was not knowing who or what had made it. 

When setting up camp, she had strategically aimed her tent towards the lake. She did this not only to have quick access to water in the middle of the night, but also to attempt to drown out her father’s snoring later on. The feint sounds of the water looping itself around the rocks on the muddy bank made drifting off to sleep a little easier for her. Not at this moment, however. She looked at her digital watch. The greenish hue lit up the contours of her tent as she tapped the small button on the side. *”3:00 am”*, she muttered as she cupped her face in her hands. 

Having slipped on her coat, she unzipped the entrance to her tent and picked up a flashlight. Aiming it right in front of her, the light illuminated what were now the ashes of the campfire. She angled the torch slightly to the right of the smolder only to see her father grumbling away in his sleeping bag. 


Eleanor made her way towards the lake. Breaching the pines that marked the small bank between their campsite and the water, she realized that turning off her flashlight at this point would not affect how brightly the moonlight glistened on the expanse before her. A blanket of dark blues and radiant whites illuminated the waters from one edge of the lake to the other. She could clearly see rocks that lined the shoreline on the opposite side, the dock just before her. 

The dock itself was nothing short of an accident waiting to happen. She had remembered seeing it every year her and her father had gone camping since she was a little girl. Now at the wise age 13, she knew exactly which areas to step on to safely make it to the edge, even in the dark, something she was sure no unexperienced camper would be able to do. She sat for a moment, dangling one leg off the edge above the water, using the other knee to rest her head on as she looked out in to the night. She loved these annual weekend getaways with her father. The Fall just wouldn’t be the same for her if she didn’t keep up this little tradition. 


A few minutes passed by as Eleanor attempted to relax and find her sense of slumber once more. She rubber one eye and picked up the tin cup she had brought with her. Kneeling down, she extended one arm holding the cup, off the edge and down towards the water. Pulling it back up to her mouth, it was nearly empty, perhaps the water was lower than she had anticipated. She tried once more, this time reaching a little further, aided by the flashlight to ensure she filled it up this time. As she leaned backwards, full cup in hand, for a brief moment the light of her torch illuminated something outwards in the lake. 

She squinted her eyes slightly as she attempted to point the light back to what it was that caught her eye. *Was it some kind of strange fish?*, she thought, using her torch as a searchlight. As muddy as the banks were, the water in the lake was crystal clear. On a midsummers day, were you to row out in to some of the deeper parts it would look as though your boat was floating on air, it was that transparent. Because of this, Eleanor knew she would be able to make out whatever it was she saw from the dock. 

*”There you are…”*, she whispered as the light found its way directly on to some yellow mass at the bottom of the lake. It was small and didn’t appear to be moving. As she focused on it to see if it would get up and swim away, the outline of her discovery became clear. It was a bright yellow boot, lying on the lake floor, about 15 to 20 feet from where she stood on the dock. Although she thought it was pretty strange, it wasn’t uncommon for teens at the town college to come out here for spring break together. Maybe one of them threw it out in to the water as a poorly thought out prank.

Just as Eleanor was about to turn away and head back to her tent for the night, she could make out another feint color under water not too far from where the yellow boot lay. It was another boot, this one red and slightly smaller. Yet another few feet back towards the dock, another item lay, this one was what appeared to be a baseball cap caught on the outstretched branch of a sunken log. Just beyond that, another item of clothing, a shoe. 

Eleanor began scanning the waters, it seemed as though she could find something in any direction she pointed her light towards. She aimed her torch down the length of the dock in an attempt to pick out any items she may have stepped by while she was half asleep. She could see two navy buttons and what appeared to be a gold ring, scattered along the mossy planks leading back to the bank.


*”What the hell happen-“*, but before she could finish, Eleanor quickly crouched down as a falcon, screaming as loud as it lungs could afford, swooped over her head and plummeted straight into the water behind her. Eleanor quickly stood up and swerved around, only to see the large bird flailing and screeching in the water before her. As she pointed her flashlight on it another splash rang out in the distance, and another and another. She frantically waved her torch around in the air, she could see flocks of birds bombarding the lake’s surface, one after another, each screaming as their wings splashed water. 


Just as Eleanor was about to turn to call out for her Father to come and see the madness that she was witnessing, a blinding blue beam of light struck her from above, the impact forcing her head upwards and her arms backwards. It struck her with the same impact of a freight truck colliding with pylon. She was deafened by a fluctuating hum from above, the sound of it ringing out like one hundred thousand fog horns all blaring at once. 

She was frozen, unable to move any part of her body with enough significance to contribute towards an escape. She felt pressure from above, below and behind each side of her body, only allowing her enough room to slightly rock back and forth in a futile panic. The pressure from above wained down on her to the extent that she could no longer close her mouth or eyelids. The electric warmth of the beam was too powerful, the hum of its source so loud it now made her ears ring. As she tried to scream she could feel tears running down her cheeks and along her neck. Her face, permanently fixed into an expression of pure terror. 


Eleanor could no longer feel her feet on the dock. She was slowly drifting upwards. Unable to move her head enough to angle it downwards, she could only see the source of the beam growing closer and closer, the hum growing louder, her heart beating faster. It was at this moment she realized…she is being taken. Taken far away from her warm tent, far away her town, far away from her father… Her father. His frantic screams were only just faintly audible over the roaring steel thunder above. She could hear him calling out to her. Calling her name, over and over.

It was only towards the last stretch of space between Eleanor and the looming source of the light above her that she finally accepted her fate, as she had grown exhausted from fighting the crushing force around her. In a final attempt to ensure there was no escape for her, she mustered every fiber of her being to shake herself free from the force. It was no use.   Her father, standing at the edge of the dock where is daughter had been only moments ago, screamed in anguish. Just as suddenly as he saw the outline of his daughter engulfed by a bright white light directly above him, the forest was plunged into darkness. The deafening hum, the blue beam, the animals screaming… it ll stopped at once. Her father was thrown in to silence as there was no trace of the light, of Eleanor, anymore. He jolted as a metallic bang set off behind him. He turned around suddenly and looked down. 

Eleanor’s father fell to his knees as he picked up her flashlight, broken on impact. Only the floating avian bodies bobbing on the lake’s surface and the sound of the water rolling between the pillars of the dock accompanied him.
