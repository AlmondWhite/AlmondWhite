After exploring some of the areas of Linux-based software I hadn’t ventured to before, I am absolutely amazed at how things have progressed.


My power was shut off a few days ago, because I am a poor person. I work remotely from home and  I had to shift myself to a temporary location to be able to not lose my job. Not only did I have to find a new place to grind out of, but I only had desktop-based workstations that I use at home so I had to build a new machine out of spare parts when I got there. 

Currently the bulk of my projects relate to web development, front-end and back-end. Regardless of what anyone may say, I personally prefer working out of Linux to get the job done. Having switched back to LXDE as my daily driver, I installed a fresh copy of Lubuntu. Having completed the whole setup phase, I went to work. 


My job requires me to bounce around between different OS’s for creating native apps and coming up with security protocols and such, so I know my setup by heart. After updating my repos and kernel headers, I usually install my favorite terminal and handle all other installs from there.  Using Lubuntu, however, means the Ubuntu Software center is included by default. Don’t ask my why, but I’ve had some mixed experiences when installing software from the Software center itself. Programs are sometimes outdated or even broken, but when I install them directly from the repos themselves I never usually have an issue. 

It’s pretty impressive how extensive the list of FOSS apps you can find on there now. Seeing tools I would have longed to have been available on Linux systems in the past really peaked my curiosity. Simple things, like a decent video editing suite or chat application that was never ported, were all up for grabs. How the younger me who was forced to boot in to Windows or spend a few hours downloading an ISO to jam in a VM, would have loved to see this day. 

So I explored. 

I tried out a few video editing suites. Lightworks was my go to, when it first came out, as I could also have a copy installed on my Windows drive had I needed to remain in the despicable OS for some other reason. So I scanned for alternatives. Kdenlive was also a familiar face as I was a KDE user for many years, but I really don’t like it. Too overly complex for the average user. 

Anyway, after having rooted around for a few more apps, I had seen most of what I wanted to. Ultimately I went back to my coding. It was only later that a friend of mine had sent me a message telling my to try out a new game he was playing. He’s a devout Windows user, so when he told me, I initially assumed it was Windows based. Plus, it’s a fucking video game. As the adage goes *“Windows is for gaming, Linux is for everything else”*. 

The game is 0AD. Never heard of it either. Apparently it was created by two devs who used to work on *Age Of Empires*, so they used the same engine. I’m not a gamer by any means. I like to build my own GameBoy games, but I rarely play any. RTS games, even less. They always looked so fucking boring to me. Fragging someone when you have 3% health remaining and you’re the final two on a map, that’s a fucking video game. *Age Of Empires* just looked like a farm simulator to me.


I tried the thing anyway. Fuck me, is it awesome. Not so much the actual game itself, but the entire piece of software. How it runs, how it renders, the visual effects, the interface. *Damn!* It’s buttery smooth. The most amazing thing was the fact that I was running this on my motherboard’s built in GPU. Shitty little Intel thing. I never bothered to install my Nvidia. I didn’t even thing I would be able to get it to run with my current GPU, let alone have it run as flawlessly as it has. 

This thing is truly an amazing feat of software engineering. Fuck. I need to write a review about this one day, it absolutely merits one. If you haven’t tried it, I encourage you to give it a shot. RTS aside, the gameplay is actually pretty engaging too. 


More to come.
