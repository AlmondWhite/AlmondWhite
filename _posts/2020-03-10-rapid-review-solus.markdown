This is a short segment where I jot down an extremely brief summary of my take on a piece of tech, media, news, etc… 

Today, I'm talking *Solus*.

<!--more-->

Solus is a Linux distro I've only recently stumbled across. My three pet distro bases are Debian, Arch and Ubuntu. To my surprise, you can't really place Solus in any of these camps. Solus is it's own thing. Literally. It uses its own variant of the Budgie desktop environment, which is styled beautifully, I mean I would love if this was freely available for other distros using Budgie. It has its own package manager and even ports over some familiar features and widgets, such as _Raven_, that have been reskinned and tweaked to match the Solus ambiance.

It would seem that the team over at Solus, wish to take things in to their own hands as much as possible when it comes to building their OS. The impression I get, is very much that they want it to be its own unique creation, as opposed to simply piggybacking off of an already established distro and tweaking a few things to make it stand out. 

As a desktop OS, it is perfect. You can craft a great development environment, Steam support is present, updates are managed in a very clean and user-friendly way. The only gripe I have would be their package management system. Whereas Snap, Flathub and their own repo do offer all of the usual go-to applications most seek out, such as Skype, Slack, Spotify, VS Code, Brave, etc… You'll find deb support for unlisted apps, kind of touch and go. 

If there is a package you wish to install that isn't listed in any of the repos supported by Solus, you can either compile it from source or ask the dev team to port it for you. Whereas compiling an app from source is almost a surefire way to get up and running with your esoteric app needs, it becomes a nightmare when you have to do the same for all dependencies needed by that app to run. I personally tried to setup a simple collection of pentesting tools, to see if I can truly take the plunge in to the Solus world, to which the majority of libraries needed for these to run were missing. Even common tools that can be applicable in a myriad of different situations such as Ettercap or John could have simply been made available in their repo… But maybe I'm being to ego-centric here. 

*In summary*, Solus is an excellent environment for the average coder or desktop user as it covers pretty much all of your everyday needs. I will be using it as a daily driver for all of my non-niche centric requirements. It's stable, easy to use, not full of bloatware, fast booting, tweakeable and just damn gorgeous to look at. 

I will take a deep dive in to this distro one day, because by God, it deserves it. But for now, these have been just some simple impressions off the top of my head. 


More to come.
