It’s been all over the place, but I just had to get this down as an affirmation that I’m not insane. 


A fucking laptop sold for 1.3 million bucks, and it wasn’t even a good one. It was a shitty Samsung from 2008. Not only that, it was running Windows XP (which as we all know, is the greatest OS mankind has ever developed) and was infected with 6 of the present most damaging viruses. 

Apparently, all this shit was supposed to be an art piece or something, and some douche actually slapped that much down for it. This is a text book definition of what I would consider an “I don’t want to live on this planet anymore” moments. Run an XP machine long enough and you’ll contract all that yourself.

WannaCry was apparently one of the infections listed, if I remember correctly. I can’t help but think that this whole thing is actually going to bring attention to these types of infections in the wrong way. The same way whenever they announce the name of a mass shooter on the news, suddenly it becomes almost fashionable to some people. That kind of thing. 

Anyways, I’m rambling on about shit in the middle of the night so take all this with a thundering pinch of salt. There are tons of articles about it online by now so if you think this kind of thing is anything other than hyped up horse shit, then [here’s][link] one for you.


Aside from this, ProtonMail was taking some serious shit today for an article written about them that tried to frame them as selling private info to law agencies, but alas, this was all a lie. 

The article itself even states it on the last two lines, but people were quick to jump on the bandwagon and condemn them to oblivion. I wrote a tweet about how I don’t buy it and got a like from them, which indicates that they’re very sharp on public opinion. I only have 4 followers on Twitter so they’re obviously keeping an eye out. 


Anyways, I’m going to bed. Fuck off.
