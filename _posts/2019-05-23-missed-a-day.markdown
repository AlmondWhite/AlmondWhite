Yes I know. I missed a day, but fuck it, I was distracted. Now? I’m finally coming down off the high. Just been through the same mind twisting bender that always leaves me right here.


Node.js and Electron have been blowing my tiny mind as of late, as I’ve been posting, and using them had put me through the same old feeling I used to get. The first language I learned to code in was Java. I wanted to teach myself a skill like that after seeing how revered the only coder in my workplace was (and how much fucking cash he got). I began to study and study and finally I wrote my first program. I was absolutely ecstatic. I couldn’t rest until could finally test my limits and what else I could make. 


After a while of coding my way through app after app, I finally got bored after a while and work became more of a distraction. It was then that I could see Java wasn’t going to work out for me. It was a dying language and fell far behind in the popularity polls. After a bit of investigating, I opted for C#, simply due to the fact that I could use a compiler like Eclipse. I began to study once more and ended up taking the same joy ride as Java, extremely super hyped and then a lull as I had recognized my limits.


You see where I’m going with this? Just been through the same shit with node almost. I love it though, the language and the system I mean. NPM is badass, all the areas it has already excelled in are impressive, and it had a massive community too. But, I’m starting to find a little low again. 


I don’t know it could just be me I guess, but this happens from time to time. It’s not like I’m going to abandon it or anything, no way, I’ve only just started. I fucking love node.js, but I need a project now. A concept so good and grand that I will have to work on it over the next few months just to get it right. Something to really test my perseverance. 


This is what always stumps me, finding a good project. Something people would find useful. I’m going to keep looking.
