something like that.



Posts here have somewhat halted during the last week or so. This was mostly due to the fact that last weekend I decided to take a break from building Electron apps at work, to build an Electron app at home. Yeah, it’s a bit weird, but I wanted to take the time to explore some techniques and areas of development I don’t get to usually touch upon at work. Building things of my own volition is pretty cool, but I did it mostly for practice I guess. 

The app I’ve been working on is nothing amazing, in fact, it’s pretty boring. I took the same approach for the concept as I do when drawing. That is to not have any idea what I’m going to create until I sketch the first shape, or in this case, line of code. With Electron, this meant creating a design in CSS and slapping some nodejs functions around it.

The application serves as a portal to perform searches for two different services: Youtube and DuckDuckGo. In the case of Youtube, it pulls up 150 videos and their details. I’m also developing a built in player to avoid having to click a link and view a result in your browser. I would be cool to have the app take care of everything. 

With the DuckDuckGo api, it uses the *”instant answers”* service to give some relevant information on a topic searched. This includes several different results and their links as well. The only issue I’m having with this is parsing the xml response from the api. I’m used to parsing json results not xml so it’s a bit of a pain. Anyways.


More to come.
