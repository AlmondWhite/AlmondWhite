The **AlmondWhite** blog is just a simple place I set up to collect my thoughts on various different facets of technology, media and philosophy? Maybe...

I really just post about things from my own point of view so that I can look back on my work and have a visual representation of why I'm an idiot. I don't agree with the censoring overlords of social media sites, so I splurt stuff out here, far from the clutches of pointless back-and-forths.

I'm not super easy to find online, but if you see me, feel free to say hi and tell me why you don't want to talk to me. 

And now, I leave you with some words that have been my sole crutch to lean on in times of despair.
