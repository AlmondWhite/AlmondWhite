Can you feel the creepies?

In Western civilizations around the world, October is the month of *spookums*. Folks band together on that one special day of the month to celebrate a tradition of collectively recognizing and causing fear to ourselves and those around us. Right?



Halloween originated from Ireland, specifically its ancient pre-catholic Druid/pagan culture. It marked a cyclically annual event in which the end of the harvest would beckon in the preparation for the coming cold winter months. Apparently it would consist of lighting a series of fires that would be ceremoniously extinguished and reignited throughout the night of the 31st of October through to the 1st of November. Not only would they gather together the crops they harvested, but they would also slaughter the livestock they harbored too. 

This was the brunt of survivalist practices they would partake in at this event. However, the they placed true significance on the recognition of it being the last day of the year for them, the *death of the year* as it were. A night in which the souls of the dead would walk the earth once more and seek out those that had wronged them in life, to get their malevolent revenge. 

This is evidently where the tradition of disguising oneself and leaving an offering of nuts or fruit to appease these malicious spirits would later become the trick or treating we partake in today. *No shit*.

It was not uncommon for Irish residents, even as recently as the 1970’s, to leave their doors unlocked on Halloween night with a bowl of fruit or nuts left at the entrance of the home as an offering to those spirits that might wander by. 



#### How far have we strayed?

We’ll it’s pretty evident we no longer slaughter livestock and store crops on Halloween nowadays, but we do seem to be keeping the true purpose of the tradition alive.

We all still dress up in various disguises, some of us still light bonfires to gather around, we still have offerings at the door in the form of candy, but most importantly, we all still recognize it as a night in which the most unimaginable and terrifying anomalies could come out to play...

Endless numbers of movies, books and tv shows depict Halloween as the night when witches, werewolves, vampires, ghosts, aliens, serial killers, squatches and baby squatches could roam the streets and forests looking to prey upon unsuspecting victims. You don’t need to look beyond 3 TV stations on the 31st to see how much of a practice keeping this depiction alive truly is. 



#### There will always be those trying to ruin it...

As with every tradition nowadays, there will always be some pretentious dipshit raising his hand and saying *“well actually, this event was just created by a bunch of corporations to sell more products to the unsuspecting masses...”*, blah, blah, blah. People always want to seem like their smarter or have an insight above the populous, don’t they?

There will always be those poor, confused, dumb fucks who think that taking a Christmas tree and covering it in Jack Skellington bobble heads and plastic pumpkins makes it a Halloween decoration. By that logic why don’t we take Easter eggs and paint them with shamrocks to pass out on Saint Patrick’s day parades. Fucksake...



#### We’re keeping it alive!

Regardless of the various takes or interpretations folks may have of this wonderful time of the year, the most important take away is that we are still practicing the tradition. Not only are we still practicing the tradition, but we are actively keeping its core principle alive (*to some extent anyway*).   Let’s keep it going folks, for many years to come, as just as those spirits who wander the earth on the night of the 31st will do so for eternity, so too should we engage in the practice of appeasing them for our own sakes. 



More to come.
