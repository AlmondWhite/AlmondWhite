We've all pretty much seen a [Joe Rogan][joe-rogan] podcast at one point or another, to which, there are always three things he talks about: 
How evil chimps are, how crazy DMT can be and intermittent fasting.

Considered a myth by many (including myself), I honestly though it to be lumped in the same categories as "Don't eat cheese before bed" and "Carrots help you see in the dark".
One of those kind of health tips that does in essence come from a place of truth, but in communication, gets a bit oversimplified. Having done just a little research on the topic, I’m about as knowledgeable as the next person on whether it's the real-deal or not.

If you poke around online, you’ll find a plethora of pages on the matter, however a vast majority of them share pretty similar views. Generally the consensus is that it is a simple and effective way of losing weight. 

For most folks, sticking to a diet or counting calories each day can be a pain in the ass. Consistency is not a quality that comes to most of us naturally. So what intermittent fasting does is simplify the whole process by allowing you a small window to actually consume what you like (as long as it doesn’t exceed the scope of regular dietary norms), leaving you all the time outside of that window to stave off your cravings.

Apparently you can expect a 7% to 8% fat-loss period within the first 2 to 3 weeks. It’s a bit of a change from what you would usually expect any given diet’s ruleset to look like, and considering the fact that you actually experience a little hunger, you probably actually feel like you're loosing weight throughout as opposed to eating greens all day and hoping the article you read comes true.

I’m giving it a try from today onwards, see how it goes. Will update here if anything significant comes of it (if I can manage to stick to the fucking thing).
