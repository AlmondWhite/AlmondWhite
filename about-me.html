<h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
<section class="post">
<p>
I'm a freak-bitch loner who walks hand-in-hand with the darkness and fears no man...
<br/>
<br/>
Nah bullshit, I'm bored so I do this in my free time. I have heartburn right now. Literally right now. <br/>
I like pi√±a coladas and long walks on the beach. Things may seems preachy and depressing, but never fear, they're actually peachy and refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
I code well in some languages and shit in others. Although I may write about real things, this site just serves 
as a place for me to dump my memories and opinions. So take it as you will.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't owe anyone fucking anything, so if you're here it's because you want to be or you were tricked in to it. 
<br/>
Thanks for stopping by. Go to the blog section, there's much more interesting stuff there.
