When they concept of the internet had first spread throughout general populous, the expectation was that for once in the history of humanity, we would achieve universal understanding and usher in a new era of global peace. 

So I mean what the fuck.


Needles to say that did not happen. In fact I’m sure the sheer number of cat images online far outweighs the number of meaningful conversations. At some point all that shit led us to people posting about what they had for dinner and how they *pray* for various catastrophic events while confronting anyone of religious persuasion with disgust. 

I don’t give a crap about all that, but what perplexes me is why trillions of bits of data get sent to **publicly** accessible sites in the form of snippets of their private lives. 

I never use any form of social media like Twitter or Reddit without using some form of pseudonym or something. I never post anything that may end up as identifiable articles related to my private live. This fucking blog is the closest thing to me expressing some of my thoughts openly online, and even then, this is all just a bunch of bullshit. 

I’ve listed my reasons for maintaining this site in previous posts, but why does everyone else do shit like this? They must be doing it for a reason. Anyway, this post is bound to be full of typos and stuff. I’m tired as hell right now. I’m only writing this to make sure my keyboard cable isn’t faulty and is actually typing crap out correctly. 

Ignore this post. Goodnight.


More to come.
