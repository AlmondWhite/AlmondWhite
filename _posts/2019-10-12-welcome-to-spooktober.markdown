Its so awesome, a word had to be invented to name it!

Welcome to the first annual celebration of all things spooky, scary, creepy, maniacal and eerily evil on this little corner of the internet!

Spooktober is a little collection of short stories and articles related to the best time of the year… Halloween! You’ll see the usual format of nonsensical random posts being shifted away from for this wonderful period of the year in favor of some spooky topics. 

Not going to lie though, I will be playing it by ear to some extent, in the sense that I never have any shortage of things to talk about when it comes to Halloween, but I’m not sure what to talk about first. Origins, rituals, traditions, all awesome things to cover. I’ll go from movie recommendations to posting my own short stories, all in the name of keepin’ it creepy!

I mean just look how many exclamation points I have already dotted around the place. You know this shit is going to be good. 


Gore to come.
