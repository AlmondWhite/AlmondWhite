So I was poking around online, looking for something to do. Usually when I'm aimlessly meandering through the cyberspace, I listen to podcasts, just to have something on in the background. I was listening to Joe Rogan's interview with Adam Curry. To my surprise, Joe had finally had a guest on again that didn't fall into the typical formulaic _[insert name here]_ format he usually sharts out… When a beautiful shining gem was thrown my way…

Typically, 90% of Joe's guests are a total copy and paste job. Just look at the past 40 podcasts he's done and I'll guarantee you the description goes along the lines of _“[Person] is a stand-up comedian, actor and author. Their new book, [Blah blah] is on sale now at…”_. Tell me you don't see a pattern there. Anyways, all that crap aside, I was hooked in to this one. Every once in a while we get a genuinely fascinating speaker on and this time it was Adam Curry. The “Podfather”, as they call him. 

Now, Adam is a lot like some of the people I know, including myself in some ways. He doesn't trust anyone but himself to handle his own personal data. Not for a minute. The guy is still using a sweet ass flip phone. Naturally, this prompted all sorts of discussions about using tech in the modern age, what alternatives he opts for and so on. This is where I was introduced to a golden little nugget. 

I'll bet you a signed 20 dollar bill that any given person you know, under the age of 60, is either on Facebook or Twitter. Those two social media behemoths rule the space of modern communication online. So, when the question of what social networking resources does Mr. Curry use, came up, he replied with *“Mastodon”*.

Naturally, my curiosity (or sheer boredom, let's call it) got the better of me. I had heard this name thrown out before amongst the crypto community on Twitter, but nonchalantly assumed it was another damn ICO. I was very wrong. It turns out that this platform is something a FOSS nut, like myself, had only dreamed when it came to searching for the golden egg that might usurp the shackles that Twitter had slapped on me. 

Mastodon is a social media platform that allows users to host their own servers, called instances, with their own dedicated TOS's and allow them to communicate across a shared network called the _Federation_. Sounds trippy I know, but it's a beautiful concept. Essentially it's a free, decentralized, anonymous open-source ad-free medium that offers people a way out from the data mining dictatorships such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and so forth. Needless to say, it is bitchin'.

People are so easily accessible, friendly, easy to communicate with and encouraging of new members. There are no sponsored accounts pushing marketing in your face, no posers just there to feed their own egos, no limitations on your own account and best of all, no data harvesters. One of the greatest features is that you can create multiple versions of your account across different instances, and if you don't like one you can simply hop over to the next. You can take all of your data with you as well. 

Now I am by no means trying to push any agenda, or even offer any useable advice for that matter. I'm a total noob when it comes to Mastodon. I've been using it for a week now and have hopped between a few different instances until I found one I liked enough to call home for a while. If you find 10 minutes of free time throughout your no-doubt _busy work routine or meaningful existence_, I urge you to give it a go. 

Personally, I'm still in the testing phase, but I do aim to verify whether I can drop Twitter completely in favor of this platform. Can't lie though, looks as though I might. To each his own, anyway. Even if it's not enough for you take the plunge and navigate away from whatever platform you most enjoy right now, at least check it out. I have met some very nice folks across several different instances, that want to actually engage in discussion, as opposed to _”like”_ farming. Did wonders for my self esteem in a way. 

See you on Mastodon!


More to come.
